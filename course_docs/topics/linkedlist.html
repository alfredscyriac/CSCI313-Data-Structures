                    <h2>Introduction to Linked Lists</h3>
                    <p>
                        A linked list is a dynamic data structure where elements are stored in nodes, 
                        and each node points to the next node in the sequence. Linked list commonly have 
                        a 'head' which incidates the first node in the linked list, a 'tail' which indicates
                        the last node in the linked list, and an int 'size' to represent how many total nodes 
                        are in the entire linked list. When we make our own implementation of the linked list,
                        instead of having a 'head' instance we will have a 'dummyhead.' A dummyhead is simply
                        a node that carrys a null value meaning it isn't considered to be a part of the 
                        linked list, but it allows us to make our methods for the linked list class 
                        in a much easier way. With that logic the real 'first' node of the linked list is the 
                        node following the dummyhead.
                    </p> 

                    <h4>Key Characteristics of Linked List:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pro: Dynamic sizing (meaning our list can smaller and larger unlike arrays)</li>
                        <li>Pro: Efficient insertions and deletions</li>
                        <li>Con: No random access</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Big-O / Time Complexity of Linked List Methods:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Inset First: O(1)</li>
                        <li>Insert Last: O(1)</li>
                        <li>Delete First: O(1)</li>
                        <li>Delete Last: O(n)</li>
                        <li>Search for Value: O(n)</li>
                        <li>Access by Index: O(n)</li>
                        <li>Insert at Index: O(n)</li>
                        <li>Delete at Index: O(n)</li>

                    <h2>Node Class</h2>
                    <p>
                        Node's are the building blocks of a linked list. Each node stores a data 
                        (this could be anything from an int, to a String, and for re-usability purposes 
                        it can be a generic). Each node also has a pointer to the next node in the linked list
                        via a reference / instance variable we create called 'next.'
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My personal preference is to create a Node.java class in the same folder I have 
                        my LinkedList.java class. It is possible to nest the node class inside of the linked list
                        class to make it more concise but I prefer it to have it's own file to make the linked
                        list class less clutered.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Constructing the Node class:</h4>
                    <pre> 
public class Node {
    String data; 
    Node next; 
    
    public Node(String data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null; 
    }
}
                    </pre>
                    <h4>Breaking down the code:</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                In this specific example we are setting our data type to be String.
                                Like mentioned previously it can be anything. The instance variable to 
                                reference the data is called 'data.' Again you can call this anything but 
                                the best practice / coding standards are: 'data', 'value', and 'val.' 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Each node has a pointer to another node when it becomes a part of a linked list 
                                thus why we give that instance variable the data type of Node, you can give the 
                                variable itself whatever you want but I highly suggest sticking with the standard
                                which is 'next.'
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                To construct a node we must be passed in one parameter which is the data to be 
                                stored by the node. What <code>this.data = data</code> really means is, set our instance variable, data, 
                                equal to the the value we just passed in through the constructor. If the value we were passed in was Node d 
                                instead of Node data we could do <code>data = d</code>, BUT since we opted for both of them to have
                                the same name it is the best practice to be <code>this.data = data</code>. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <code>this.next = null</code> may come of as confusing.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
