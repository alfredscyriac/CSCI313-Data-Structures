# Hash Tables 

## Basic Concept 
- Hashmaps are also referred to as hash tables
- Essentially it is an array that holds key value pairs at each index 
- Think of a key value pair as the correlation between a student ID to a student's name

## Hash Function 
Hash functions convert the keys into a specific array index
- 

## Key Characteristics 
- **Average Time Complexity**: O(1) for search, insert, and delete 
- **Worst Case Time Complexity**: O(n) when collisions occur
